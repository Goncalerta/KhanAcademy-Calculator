# Calculator

- A simple calculator to add, subract, multiply and divide numbers.
- See if you can find a way to break the universe.

This is a project originally made by me (Goncalerta) in [KhanAcademy](http://khanacademy.org/) back in 2015.
Almost no changes where made, only those really needed to make it able to run outside the website.
